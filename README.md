## How it works?
I'm downloading excel files for specific fields of study (will be automated soon) and then parsing its rows to the dictionary.
Then it's filtered by chosen groups, parsed to ical file and shown on the screen with a link to the generated ical included.

## University of Lower Silesia
Thanks to [raczu](https://github.com/raczu) and his [project](https://github.com/raczu/DSW-schedule-scrapper) now we can implement timetable views for University of Lower Silesia.
